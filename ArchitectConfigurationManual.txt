config.yml
Main configuration file of MCME-Achictet plugin.

ServerResourcePacks:
In this section server resource packs defined. The key of each entry determines the name of the 
server rp used in Architect plugin. If the associated value is identical to 
an server pack URL in ResourceRegions plugin Architect plugin will open the matching custom block
inventory when a player presses 'F' (swap hand items).
Depening on this configuration:
- /rp <serverResourcePackName> switches to that rp.
- /inv b rp:<serverResourcePackName> opens custom block inventory for that pack.

'number' are already places within 'radius' blocks a warning will be displayed to the player placing 
the block.

headGalleryLocation:
In this section the location of the Custom Head Gallery is stored. This section is handled by ingame 
command /chead setCollection it should not be changed manually.



defaultWorldConfig.yml and <worldName>.yml
World specific configuration of Architect plugin. Placed in folder 'WorldConfig'. For each world the configuration specified in
defaultWorldConfig.yml is used as default. Each Value may be overriden in a world specific configuration
file. If these files don't exist for any reason they are created automtically.

automatically and set to true (enabled) as default. Set to false to disable a module.

the noPhysicsList from defaultWorldConfig.yml can be overridden as whole only.

by block ID. Possible values are:
'TRUE' Access always allowed

'BUILDER' Access is allowed for players with build permission only
'EXCEPTION' Access is allowed in redstone circuit exception areas for players with build permission.

noInteraction:

As keys block IDs are expected. The data values of the disabled block states are give as values.

data values. You may specify several ranges or individual data values like CACTUS: 0;4-7;12-15




Custom Inventory Configuration
These files can be used to create custom block and item inventories. Block inventory configuration is in 
folder 'inventories/block' item inventory configuration in 'inventories/item'. For each server resource
pack defined in config.yml a folder with the pack name (not the rp filename but the name defined in config.yml)
is created automatically. All files placed in these folders are used for inventory configuration. Filenames 
are ignored. See custom inventory configuration manual (soon) for details.
